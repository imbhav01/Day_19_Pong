    <h1>The Pong Project using Turtle module in Python</h1>
    <p>This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Pong using the Turtle module in Python. The game features two paddles controlled by the players, a ball that bounces off the walls and the paddles, and a scoring system that keeps track of the points earned by each player.</p>
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>To run the Pong game, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download Python 3 from the official website <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a>. Once Python is installed, you will also need to install the Turtle module by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:</p>
    <code>pip install turtle</code>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>To start the Pong game, simply run the <code>pong.py</code> file in your Python environment. The game will open in a new window and you can use the arrow keys to control the paddles.</p>
    <h2>Customization</h2>
    <p>If you would like to customize the game, you can modify the code in the <code>pong.py</code> file. You can change the size of the game window, the speed of the ball, the color of the paddles and the ball, and more. The code is well-commented and easy to understand, so you should be able to make any changes you need.</p>
